# finetuning-resnet18-with-Google-Colab

This project is about finetunning resnet18 model using CIFAR-10 dataset.
It illustrates:
how to unfreeze the last CNN block and train the model from the last CNN block onwards as well as the simpler approach of training only the last fully connected layer;
how to train the model with a fixed learning rate and with discriminative learning rates;
and finally, how to visualize model predictions.

Keywords:
CNN, resnet18, CIFAR-10, finetuning, pretrained model, fully connected layer, CNN block, unfreezing CNN layers, fixed learning rate, discriminative learning rates
